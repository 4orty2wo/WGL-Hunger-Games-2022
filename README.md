This is a modification of a Bingo Minecraft server plugin for Spigot to serve as a custom Minecraft Hunger Games plugin. This is custom made for a specific Rutgers Esports co-hosted by the Women's Gaming League (WGL) in May of 2022. This plugin likely will not run on any current version of Spigot or Paper due to it being a "single use" plugin for one event.
